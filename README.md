# Kitti
A kids activity fun timer written in ReactJS.

## What is Kitti?

Kitti is an abbreviation for **Ki**ds Ac**t**ivi**t**y T**i**mer and also sounds like a small cat ... meow.

Kitti is an app that will help your child understand time by visualizing it rather than by just talking about it. You and your child choose a task, reward and activity and set the timer. A progress bar and countdown will visualize the remaining fun time. The basic idea is that the longer your child takes to complete a task the less fun time she/he will have.

## How does it work?

Check out the [web browser app](https://greenmoon1558-kitty.herokuapp.com) to see how it works. Heroku [puts apps to sleep](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#dyno-sleeping) that don't receive traffic in a 30 minute period. It takes about 30s to one minute for the app to "wake up, so please be patient.
